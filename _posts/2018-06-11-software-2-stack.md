## Training Datasets

The part around building and managing datasets is very interesting.
We don't get to hear about these problems often.

## Software 2.0 Integrated Development Enviroments (IDEs)

What IDEs including code editors will look like?

- Show a full inventory or statistics of the current dataset.
- Create or edit annotation layers for any datapoint.
- Flag, escalate & resolve discrepancies in multiple labels.
- Flag and escalate datapoints that are likely to be mislabeled.
- Display predictions on an arbirary set of test datapoints.
- Autosuggest datapoints that should be labeled.
